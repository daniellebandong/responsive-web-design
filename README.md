# Responsive Web Design
This project was created in my Intermidiate Web Development class. The object was to create a single, responsive page using the Bootstrap 5.0 framework. All CSS styling was done using Bootstrap's pre-written CSS classes.

## Objectives
The focus of this assignment was demonstrate well-formed and structured HTML markup from a reference image. Links are static and do not navigate to additional webpages.
[Demo of what the site looks like](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46451872/174500902-751fdad1-586c-430d-a8a9-89ed8c9464e4.JPG)

Additional items to note:
- Used a 'sticky' header to stay at the top of the screen when scrolling
- The navigation is fully responsive and expands at the large breakpoint
- The toggle navigation and carousel required Bootstrap's JavaScript library
