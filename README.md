#Responsive Web Design
This project was created in my Web Design Fundamentals class. The object was to create a single, responsive page using the Bootstrap 5.0 framework. All CSS styling was done using Bootstrap's pre-written CSS classes.

##Objectives
The focus of this assignment was demonstrate well-formed and structured HTML markup from a reference image. Links are static and do not navigate to additional webpages.

Additional items to note:
- Used a 'sticky' header to stay at the top of the screen when scrolling
- The navigation is fully responsive and expands at the large breakpoint
- The toggle navigation and carousel required Bootstrap's JavaScript library
